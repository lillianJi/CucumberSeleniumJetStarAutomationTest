# JetStar Automation Testing,Based on BDD/Cucumber/Selenium
This is an automation testing project which automate the workflow of book ticket and login on JetStar WebSite,using Cucumber and Selenium,executing by Junit, based on BDD framework.It also publish the results of a cucumber run as pretty html reports.

## Background
#### BDD
BDD,Behavior Driven Development,is complete methodology, this methodology is for whole organization,not only development team. We usually use BDD to organize our product development ,to ensure that people are communicating effectively together ,to foster collaboration and communication between technical people and non-technical people , to find where the biggest business value is and how the system should behave。
It also enable the development team to develop the code in a way that directly addresses the needs of customer. These automated tests and scenarios make great living documentation, for example we use cucumber based on BDD framework, it is easier to keep everyone on one-page review.
#### Cucumber
Cucumber, along with Gherkin, is the testing framework,following the principles of Behavioural Driven Design and living documentation . Gherkin is the business language we use to write the tests in a “human readable” way. Cucumber ties the Gherkin feature files to the execution code written in Ruby. Cucumber helps us capture test results as well. 
#### Selenium
Selenium is the HTTP driver used to navigate a browser from code. Often people refer to user interface automated tests as “Selenium Tests” but these are more accurately called “Behavior Driven” or “Acceptance Driven” tests.
#### How does it work

##### Feature Files
These files are a vital part of Cucumber meant to write testing automation methods and acceptance tests. All the feature files end with a .feature extension.  Every feature made up of a number of scenarios to describe how the system supposed to behave . 
##### Scenario
This focuses on a single functionality which is being taken up for automated testing. Having a glance through the scenario, one should be able to judge the sole objective behind the test.You can think of a scenario as a test case or as a example of a single behavior of system.   There is a particular format that each scenario follows and this language is known as ‘Gherkin’:
* Given: Prior settings
* When: At the time of some action
* Then: Anticipated result
* Background: Steps to be executed in each scenario
* And: Merge 2 or more similar actions
##### Tags
Tags are named for feature files and for scenarios when a similar set is to be executed for multiple instances.
##### Junit Runner
Cucumber uses standard Junit Runner to execute a particular feature file, while automated testing.
##### Cucumber Report
It generates its own html format.
