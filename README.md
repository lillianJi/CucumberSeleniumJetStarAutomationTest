## Background
#### BDD
BDD,Behavior Driven Development,is complete methodology, this methodology is for whole organization,not only development team. We usually use BDD to organize our product development ,to ensure that people are communicating effectively together ,to foster collaboration and communication between technical people and non-technical people , to find where the biggest business value is and how the system should behave。
It also enable the development team to develop the code in a way that directly addresses the needs of customer. These automated tests and scenarios make great living documentation, for example we use cucumber based on BDD framework, it is easier to keep everyone on one-page review.
#### Cucumber
Cucumber, along with Gherkin, is the testing framework,following the principles of Behavioural Driven Design and living documentation . Gherkin is the business language we use to write the tests in a “human readable” way. Cucumber ties the Gherkin feature files to the execution code written in Ruby. Cucumber helps us capture test results as well. 
#### Selenium
Selenium is the HTTP driver used to navigate a browser from code. Often people refer to user interface automated tests as “Selenium Tests” but these are more accurately called “Behavior Driven” or “Acceptance Driven” tests.
